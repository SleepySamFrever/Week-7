        <!--There are two types of lists we can create in HTML. Ordered and unordered-->
        <!--Ordered is where the items in the list are numbered, implying that the order matters-->
        <!--Unordered is just the opposite. Not numbered, but typically bulleted-->


        <!--<ol> is used for ordered lists. Below is the outcome of a race with winners ordered. Each element is wrapped in <li>-->
        <ol>

            <li>Sam</li>
